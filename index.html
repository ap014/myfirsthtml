                                    My related work experiences are below:

                                    1.Taifo ISP provider customer service: mainly answer phone call online &
                                    consulting
                                    how bandwidth our customers suit best

                                    2.Dlink Technical Support Engineer:consulting service,and provide best customer
                                    services to each customers.
                                    During these period time,I learned what DHCP,PPPoE and TCP/IP,WiFi connection
                                    is.
                                    test wifi connections and build environment to verify what trouble our
                                    customerts
                                    encountered and try to find the best way to solve it.
                                    Examle, one of our quests need to play nitento Switch, but seems not support 5G
                                    specific channel,asked them try to adjust to 36-64／100-140 Hz.

                                    3.Lunfa technology assistant Networking Engineer
                                    use CMD cli troubleshooting and target on http error code to troubleshoot, try
                                    to
                                    figure out the problems belong to local or Network layer.
                                    For example, our merchant will report a URL to us ,we need to check its DNS
                                    resolution and CDN setting rules to target problems belong to Networker layer or
                                    Server.
                                    So we need to understand what the flow is, so we could solve it as soon as
                                    possible
                                    to lower customer loss.If Server on prem we need to check f5 setting, like
                                    Virual
                                    Server,pool setting and iRule setting.

                                    e.g.our merchant provide a url and its backend ip is pointing on prem, but users
                                    got
                                    http error code 502,and we check this url setting on CDN portal,502 code
                                    responsed
                                    from origin ip 152.x.x.x.
                                    So we need to check on prem setting,include firewall and f5 virtual setting,
                                    which
                                    requires to chec iRule also to see if this url is added into datagroup or not.

                                    extensive experience in customer services,which means I get used to collect
                                    information from customers as possible as I can.
